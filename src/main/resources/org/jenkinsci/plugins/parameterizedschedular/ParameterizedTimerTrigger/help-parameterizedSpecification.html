	<strong>follow convension of cron, schedule with name=value
		pairs at the end of each line.</strong>
	<p>Everything up till the % character is just like the normal
		Jenkins Cron-like schedular. Then afte the % character you should
		format your parameters as name value pairs separated by equals and
		semicolons: name=value;othername=othervalue</p>

	<p>
		There are of course limitations to what can be passed as parameters.
		As well as what types of parameters can be assigned. The internal
		mechanism leans on the same HTTP POST request method for triggering
		builds as documented in <a
			href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Build">Launching
			a build with parameters.</a>
	<ul>
		<li>don't use semi-colons in the values</li>
		<li>don't use equals in the values</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a first step toward solving <a
			href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-16352">this
			Jenkins issue</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Examples:</p>
	<pre>
# every fifteen minutes (perhaps at :07, :22, :37, :52)
H/15 * * * * %name=value
# every ten minutes in the first half of every hour (three times, perhaps at :04, :14, :24)
H(0-29)/10 * * * * % name=value; othername=othervalue
</pre>
